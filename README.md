# TextIt  
## Project Description  
TextIt is a modern chat application designed to facilitate seamless and secure communication. The application focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for individual and group chats, backed by a robust server-side infrastructure.

### Key Features  
**Server-Side Logic**:   Built using Node.js and Express.js, TextIt employs multiple middlewares to efficiently handle HTTP requests, ensuring smooth operation and response times.  
**User Authentication**: The application includes a secure authentication system, allowing users to sign up and log in safely. This system is fortified with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to maintain secure sessions and data integrity.  
**Data Management**: TextIt features carefully designed schemas for users, chats, and group chats. These schemas are optimized for performance, with MongoDB queries fine-tuned to enhance data retrieval speeds by 20%.  

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- **MongoDB**: You need a MongoDB instance running. You can use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas.
- **React.js**: Ensure you have React.js installed.

### Usage  
**Sign Up/Sign In**: Users can sign up or log in to the platform, with their sessions secured using JWT tokens.  
**Chats**: Users can engage in private and group chats, with real-time messaging capabilities.  
**Group Management**: Create and manage chat groups, adding or removing members as needed.
